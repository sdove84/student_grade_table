# Student Grade Table
Student grade table is a content management application with CRUD functionality that keeps track of student courses and grades. Users are able to add and delete students from the provided API database and display them in a table.

Technologies Used
-
- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- JavaScript 
- jQuery
-  Bootstrap

Steps that I took
-
The starting point for student grade table is providing the HTML skeleton and CSS styling using Bootstrap classes. Then functionality is incorporated that lets students be added locally.

 Then comes incorporating the delete functionality. When clicking on the delete button, the student corresponding to the button is removed from the table.

The table is now populated with student data from the provided API database in addition to containing local stored data.

 This part builds off of the previous part of this by adding more CRUD functionality. Create and delete functionality is now added so that student information that has been added or deleted will be retained on load.
